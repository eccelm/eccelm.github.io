So, after yesterdays research I’ve decided to build my portfolio in 🥁*drumroll*🥁  React / GatsbyJS!

I would really like to continue practising React, and using GatsbyJS will allow me to look into GraphQL a bit.

At the Christmas break I had started a test portfolio styled with Bootstrap5. I really liked how it was looking, and I am a BIG fan of it taking care of responsive resizing, but seeing as it is still in alpha (V5.0) I’ve decided it is probably not best to continue with it.  However there is a react-bootstrap library that I definitely will be making use of. 

I appreciate the downside to Bootstrap is the lack of uniqueness to a site, it is generally instantly recognizable, but for getting a simple and clean portfolio up and running I hope it will do the job!
