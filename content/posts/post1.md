Well the first Monday after finishing the bootcamp, and it felt odd to not be sitting down to a morning Zoom lecture with my cohort. 

After a weekend of no code, I’m ready to get back to coding and the first port of call is getting my portfolio and projects in order! Today I’m planning what needs to be done to finish off my showcase projects, how I’m going to build my portfolio and what my next learning priorities are.

I plan to use this blog half as a record and reflection of my progress, but also as a good motivational prod to keep exploring and expanding my skillset.
