Hello test post

So as a little round up of what needs doing, we need to use shadowing to alter the top

Also would be good to look into the difference concerning the second folder on theme-ui and whether it can be swapped out for react-bootstrap? At any rate get things looking nice and consistent-sh in colour scheme

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/#buttons

https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/ and click through to official docs which link to a V4 of botostrap
This seems useful for going back to understanding CSS in the context of React-Bootstrap
